At the Child Vision Lab, we research visual development and plasticity to understand how children learn to see and interact with the world, and how the human visual system can overcome eye disease.

We create fun, child-friendly research studies that help us discover:

- What infants and children can see and how their visual skills develop
- How the brain can adapt when infants and children are born with visual impairments
- What processes cause the sensory system and motor system to start working together better during development
- How does the brain respond when adult vision becomes impaired, using our knowledge of visual development

We use state-of-the-art scientific approaches and techniques, whilst introducing parents and children to real scientific experiments in a fun and playful manner.
